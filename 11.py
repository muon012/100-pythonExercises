# Exercise No.11

# Create a list dynamically with the integers 1-20

# Solution

print(list(range(1, 21)))

# range()  is a Python built-in function that generates a range of integers.
# However, range()  creates a Python range object. To get a real list object
# you need to use the list() function to convert the range object into a list object.
